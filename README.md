# PROBLEM STATEMENT
A web-based application designed to provide users with detailed nutritional information about various food items. By leveraging Google Generative AI, the application delivers instant, comprehensive data on macronutrients (protein, fat, carbohydrates), micronutrients (vitamins, minerals), and calorie content. This tool aims to assist individuals in making informed dietary choices and understanding the nutritional value of the foods they consume.

# SOLUTION
Many individuals struggle with creating healthy and satisfying meal plans that align with their specific needs and preferences. NutriGen addresses this challenge by generating personalized meal plans based on user input. Users can provide information about their dietary restrictions, allergies, health conditions, activity levels, and taste preferences. The AI then crafts a week-long meal plan with recipes and grocery lists, ensuring nutritional balance, variety, and enjoyment.
